            2 consecutive swaps not possible
            let dp[i][0] be sum possible if ith num is not swapped
                if not swapped, we can choose maximum of sums where i-1 is OR is not swapped
                ie dp[i-1][0] OR dp[i-1][1]
            
                dp[i][1] be sum possible if ith num is swapped
                only sums where i-1 is NOT swapped can be chosen, as we CANNOT have 2 consecutive swaps
                ie dp[i-1][0]
                
                hence, 
                dp[i][0] = nums[i] + max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1]);
                dp[i][1] = -1*nums[i] + dp[i-1][0]
                
                CANNOT HAVE 2 CONSECUTIVE SWAPS IS THE DP CONDTION
                
                hence result would simply be max(dp[n-1][0], dp[n-1][1])
                
                some states are invalid, e.g. swapping first elem is not possible as previous should be swapped
                hence, dp[0][1] = LLONG_MIN
                
                we need to choose a default to represent an invalid state, which shouldn't affect dp composition
                min possible sum => -10^9 * 10^5 = -10^14 < 2^63 (LLONG_MIN), hence LLONG_MIN can be chosen as default

                Because the DP solution depends only on prev state, we can avoid having a O(N) dp array, and just store the prev states in O(1)
                and iteratively update them as we go
